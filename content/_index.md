## Introduction

This **cookbook** encompasses a growing set of proven recipes that will help accelerate your journey to the cloud.

Cookbooks are developed by engineers for their peers. They are instrumental in sharing knowledge, so that no one has to solve the same problems again and again while scaling modernization work. Our cookbooks use the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static web site generator, and recipes are written in [Markdown](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/).

A **recipe** is a short article explaining how to solve a specific problem, or providing step-by-step instructions for completing a task. Recipes can include code snippets, patterns, or best practices.
